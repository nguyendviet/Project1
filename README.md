WHY WE BUILT THIS APP?

This app was created to solve a real problem:

Groups of people often have a hard time deciding where to go for dinner. We decided to solve this problem in a fun and interactive way. We built a multiplayer game that asks players to solve the name of a food dish. When a player guesses the dish correctly, the Google Places API does a search for restaurants with that dish nearby, the Google Maps API returns a map that displays those restaurants, and the What 3 Words API displays the “3 Word Address” assigned to that location. The winner of the game chooses the restaurant they will go to from the list, and the other players receive the location the winner chose.

HOW THIS APP WORKS?

Everyone signs in with names.
The game can only be started if there're 2 players or more.
If a user quits after joining, the existing players will have to reset the game.
