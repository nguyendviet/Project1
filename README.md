=================================================================

Use this link to run the app: https://nguyendviet.github.io/Project1/

From Viet: Added: app.js, style.css Edited: index.html

=====>IMPORTANT: use your own firebase for testing.

Logic works:

Step 1: First load, see log in. When logged in, see create game button if no game is created, else, see join game button (ignore the game ID input for now).

Step 2: Once game created, everybody sees change.

If 1 player in game, player can't start game. If 2 or more, users can start game.

Step 3: Once game started, everybody sees change. Prevent unregistered (no-name) players join when game is started.

Step 4: If a player left, game continues. If players left but 1, display join button to others, the current player waits.

Step 5: Game can start again normally when start button pressed.

- No errors found.
- All possibilities checked.
