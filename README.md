From Viet:
Added: app.js, style.css
Edited: index.html

=====>IMPORTANT: use your own firebase for testing.

Logic works:

Step 1:
First load, see log in.
When logged in, see create game button if no game is created, else, see join game button (ignore the game ID input for now).

Step 2:
Once game created, everybody sees change.

If 1 player in game, wait. If 2 or more, start button appears.

Step 3:
Once game started, everybody sees change.
Prevent unregistered (no-name) players join when game is started.

Step 4:
If player left, game continues.
If players left but 1, display join button to others, current player waits.

Step 5:
Game can start again normally when start button pressed.

- No errors found.
- All possibilities checked.
